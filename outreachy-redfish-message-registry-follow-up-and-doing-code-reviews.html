    <h4>Message Registry</h4>
<p>Since the last blog post, I have started implementing Message Registry. I am splitting this feature in several patches starting with the easy parts - mapping Message Registry File and Message Registry resources to sushy fields. In order to implement this, encountered a need for a new data structure that was not present in sushy base fields - dictionary and implemented this before everything else. Currently these 3 patches are in code review.</p>
<p>Having taken a closer look at Message Registry File turns out there are 3 ways how to serve the Registry file itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>locally as a JSON file,</li>
<li>locally in an archive as a JSON file,</li>
<li>publicly on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also 4th use case for sushy to serve standard message registry files when a Redfish services has not included them - sushy has to get them elsewhere. This use case was mentioned in the previous blog post when we encountered licensing issue as the standard message files provided by DMTF are only copyrighted without any license. Previously we were at the stage that it looked like they will have BSD 3 clause license, but as DMTF did not see them as code, they rejected this idea. Going back to OpenStack legal mailing list, they suggested to use CC license which currently is in review by DMTF.</p>
<p>So I need to implement registry file loading to support all these use cases. It is not difficult task as such, but I need to implement so it aligns with sushy design nicely. I have implemented yet another changes to sushy base classes, this time BaseResource to allow processing archives and I'm thinking how should I split these changes in code reviews - should changes to BaseResource be separate from implementing Message Registry loading or go together so that there is context and actual use case of the changes. I don't want to split too much and I don't want to create patch too big. But actually I'm not thinking about this too much, or at least I try not to, because this can take forever, so I just do it whatever, any decision can be fixed later.</p>
<p>To locally test my changes, I needed to have a somewhat working fake Redfish server that has Registry Files supported. None of the mockups provided by DMTF have these Registries included, so I added my own mock files for Registries. The next thing - how to serve them. This looks like the use case for sushy-static emulator where it needs just a bunch of JSON files, but in this particular use case I also want to test work with a ZIP archive. Turns out sushy-static emulator is written that it only serves JSON files and understands URL-s that correspond to folder structure and returns index.json files in those folders, definetly not supporting URL or file ending with .zip. Something to think about, if needed in sushy-static, but I'm on mission to quickly test my code. So far, it was enough to test in unit tests, but for unit tests I need to know what I need to mock, this time I need a real-life setup to observe this in action. The next fastest thing to setup static file serving would be a localhost web server. I set up nginx to serve static files on my computer. I'm using Fedora and never have used web server on Fedora, so I turns out that SELinux was blocking my choice of port, 2000, and I had some issues with permissions, but did set it up and was able to test my changes and decide how to mock connection.</p>
<h4>Code reviews</h4>
<p>Apart from working on these changes, I'm doing code reviews. In both directions - responding to changes on my patches and leaving some feedback on other patches. Since previous blog one of the patches - emulating BIOS in sushy-emualtor got merged \o/, but code review for Ethernet Interface emulation is still in progress. Most of the time it just sits and waits for attention from code reviews as I try to respond as soon as I can while avoiding to switch context when I'm working on new patches. Usually this means that I start or end my days with code reviews. Responding to code reviews can take a lot of time. I think there have been days where that's all I do. Sometimes there are questions in code reviews to which I don't know the best answer and I have to do my own research or try things out. Other thing that re-occurs in code reviews that I get comments about the code which I have written in the same style as already existing code. Which means that if I address the comment in my patch, the overall project style will vary and will become messy. And I don't believe that it is a good thing, the project style should be the same even if it is 'wrong' or 'bad'. Probably 'consistent' is one of the most used words in my code review comments. If it is decided that these changes are necessary, then they are done in a follow-up patch and addressed across the project to keep consistency. This also applies when I'm reviewing other patches - trying to not diverge from the consistency there is in the project. In addition to making the project easier to maintain and code easier to read, the consistency makes contribition for newcomers easier as it serves as a self-referencing sample how should implement any new features. If there were different approaches - how to know which one to pick and why? Maybe then come up with just another way how to implement it and contribute to chaos. This is one of the main things that PEP8 does not catch :) and reviewers need to take care of.</p>
